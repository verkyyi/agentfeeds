description: Use Agent Feeds for ambient awareness from continuously refreshed local streams under ~/.agentfeeds. Use at session start to install/check background refresh and insert a compact stream brief, and before web search or expensive source-specific queries when a prompt may be covered by changing local context such as RSS/news, GitHub, calendars, weather, local files, personal sources, templates, subscriptions, or subscribed stream state.

# Agent Feeds

Agent Feeds is a local-first ambient context layer for agents. A background fetcher keeps changing stream state warm on disk so agents can answer from local, inspectable context before re-searching, querying, processing, or asking the user to repeat information.

Use this skill at session start, when managing feeds/subscriptions/templates, and before web search or expensive source-specific work if subscribed local state may already cover the prompt.

Requires shell access, Python 3.11+, and either `pip` or `uv` for setup. Background polling is supported on macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, and WSL-style POSIX environments. The bundle includes a frozen template catalog for first use; network access is needed for setup, remote catalog updates, and public feed refreshes.

## Command Map

Use the bundled scripts from the skill root:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py brief
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py search <topic> --json
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py streams health --json
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py streams read <subscription-id> --limit 20 --json
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates search <query>
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py subscribe <template-id> [key=value ...]
python3 scripts/agentfeeds_fetch.py --stream <subscription-id>
```

`python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py` is the management CLI. `python3 scripts/agentfeeds_fetch.py` is the refresh worker. Runtime state defaults to `~/.agentfeeds/`; treat the file layout as an implementation detail except when debugging or editing a scaffolded local template.

Vocabulary:

- Template: reusable feed definition. Some templates are ready to subscribe with no parameters; others require parameters.
- Subscription: configured active instance of a template.
- Stream: refreshed readable data for an active subscription.

References to load only when needed:

- Runtime setup details: `references/runtime-setup.md`
- Template authoring details: `references/template-authoring.md`
- Background refresh details: `references/background-refresh.md`

Built-in templates come from the standalone catalog repo `https://github.com/verkyyi/agentfeeds-catalog` and are cached locally; user-local templates live under `~/.agentfeeds/templates/`.
The release bundle includes a frozen built-in catalog fallback so first-run discovery does not depend on GitHub being reachable.

## Session Start

At the start of each session:

1. If the bundled CLI fails because dependencies are missing, run `python3 scripts/setup.py`.
2. Check background refresh with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py polling status --json`; if missing, run `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py polling install`.
3. Check stream health with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py streams health --json`.
4. Generate stable compact context with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py brief`.
5. If the host supports prompt slots, place the exact brief output in a system-level or persistent context slot so stable stream metadata can benefit from model-side prompt caching.

The default brief avoids volatile timestamps. Use `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py brief --include-freshness` only for freshness/debugging questions.

If health reports errors, missing state, or stale state, continue with available local context but tell the user ambient awareness is degraded when it affects the answer.

## Answering Flow

When a user prompt may be covered by subscribed changing context:

1. Search local state first: `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py search <topic> --json`.
2. If matches are non-stale and answer the prompt, read the matching stream with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py streams read <subscription-id> --limit 20 --json` and answer from local state.
3. If a matching stream is stale and freshness matters, refresh it with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds_fetch.py --stream <subscription-id>`, then search/read again.
4. If health shows a fetch error or missing state, explain the degraded source and ask for reconfiguration only when needed.
5. Use web search or source-specific external tools only when local streams do not cover the prompt, are stale and cannot refresh, or the user explicitly asks for outside/current web information beyond subscribed data.

Use `streams search` only for stream metadata discovery. Use top-level `search` for content snippets.

## Subscribe And Manage

When the user asks to subscribe to a source:

1. Search built-ins first with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates search <query>`.
2. Inspect likely matches with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates show <template-id> --json`.
3. Prefer a built-in template when it fits the source shape and auth model.
4. Collect only required parameters, then subscribe with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py subscribe <template-id> [key=value ...]`.
5. Confirm with `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py streams health --json` and, if useful, one stream read.

For unsubscribe:

```bash
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py streams list
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py unsubscribe <subscription-id>
```

If the user names a template instead of a concrete subscription, list matching active streams and ask which one to remove.

## Template Strategy

Balance built-in templates and local authoring this way:

- Use built-in templates for common source classes, stable public APIs, shared schemas, and anything many operators would reuse.
- Use parameterized built-ins for source families: RSS/Atom URLs, GitHub repos, iCalendar URLs, weather coordinates, public JSON APIs.
- Use local templates for private files, private dashboards, one-off APIs, local tools, experimental sources, and operator-specific commands.
- Do not author a local template until built-ins have been checked and no suitable template fits.
- If a local template proves broadly useful, suggest upstreaming it to the catalog rather than keeping many near-duplicate local templates.
- Prefer local/private read-only sources before suggesting public feeds when the user wants personal context.

When no built-in template fits:

```bash
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates adapters
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates scaffold <adapter-kind> <template-id>
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates validate
python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates test <template-id> key=value
```

Read `references/template-authoring.md` before editing scaffolded template YAML.

For `local_command` templates, use argv arrays only. Only create command templates for explicitly requested or approved read-only commands. Avoid commands that mutate files, cloud resources, accounts, or external services. Before testing, subscribing, or refreshing a `local_command` template, show the exact command to the user and run `python3 scripts/agentfeeds.py templates approve-command <template-id> [key=value ...]` only after they approve it.

## Safety Rules

- Use `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` for subscription changes.
- Use `agentfeeds_fetch.py` or `agentfeeds.py refresh` for refreshes.
- Do not hand-write state or status files.
- Do not include secrets in template YAML.
- Treat Agent Feeds as warm changing context, not durable memory, semantic search, or a data warehouse.
